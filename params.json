However, the venerable Daemons are blocking your way. Use your spell to beat them!\r\n\r\n- ![Daemon 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yvar-deGoffau/ProjetJava/master/model/src/main/java/Sprite/monster_1.png)  This daemon prefer the attack to the defence. It will try to attack you all the time, not withstanding walls. However, it can't see around a corner; try to beat him with corners!\r\n- ![Daemon 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yvar-deGoffau/ProjetJava/master/model/src/main/java/Sprite/monster_2.png) This daemon is very clever, and thus quite dangerous. It will often wait behind a corner to attack you, making him very difficult to dodge. Beat him by your speed!\r\n- ![Daemon 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yvar-deGoffau/ProjetJava/master/model/src/main/java/Sprite/monster_4.png)  This daemon will scan all the corridors to find you. However, it will often miss splits; attract him, hide in there, and use your spell with a good timing!\r\n- ![Daemon 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yvar-deGoffau/ProjetJava/master/model/src/main/java/Sprite/monster_3.png)  This daemon will lurk around, without specifically seeking you. However, it goes ways no other daemon will go. Try to find his path; then you can have him easily!\r\n\r\n## Controls\r\n\r\n Upon starting the program, you need to select the level number.\r\n\r\n Use your numpad to move, and 5 to fire. \r\n\r\n ![numpad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yvar-deGoffau/ProjetJava/master/numpad.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compiling\r\n\r\n Use Eclipse / Maven to compile. You will need Maven, and Maven will install the other dependencies automatically\r\n\r\n\r\n",
