### Lorann

 This is an old game from the French Thombson MO5 computer, ported to Java by a team of 3 students from the Exia-Cesi.

## The Game

 The goal is to take the Energy Ball, and then quit the level using the door. However, the venerable Daemons are blocking your way. Use your spell to beat them!

## Controls

 Upon starting the program, you need to select the level number.

 Use your numpad to move, and 5 to fire. 


## Compiling

 Use Eclipse / Maven to compile. You will need Maven, and Maven will install the other dependencies automatically
